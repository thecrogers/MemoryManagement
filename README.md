# MemoryManagement
In this group project I and another student implemented a memory management simulation.
The first method uses the malloc system call to free memory for the 25 process that are generated randomly. 
The second method that was implemented was memory management algorithm know as the buddy system. 
This algorithm uses a binary tree abstract data type to store memory allocations, where at each child node is half the size of the parent. 
This simulation will show the time differences between the system malloc call and our memory management algorithm.
